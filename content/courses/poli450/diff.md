  ## Creating new content
  Read the docs [here](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/) to read about managing content. Here are a few differences.

Instead of typing
```
hugo new  --kind project project/my-project-name
```
in your terminal, type
```
hugo new  --kind project projects/my-project-name
```

The same applies to: `post/` -> `posts/`, `talk/` -> `talks/`, `project/` -> `projects`
