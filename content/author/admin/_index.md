Hello!! I'm JohnJung. 

I'm learning programming. I'm quite interested in all aspects of software development. My passion lies in the web application development including both the front end and the back end. I fell in love with the modern JavaScript Since I changed my major. 

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you enjoy looking around :)
